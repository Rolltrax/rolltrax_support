# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is a Rolltrax group?

A Rolltrax group is best thought of as a class. While there are no limitations to the amount of groups you can create, we recommend one group per school per coordinator.

## What else do I need to start?

The only other component required to have a functional Rolltrax ecosystem is a computer (Windows, macOS, and Linux are supported). Apart from this, there may be additional components required depending on the configuration being used.

The preferred method is to buy an omnidirectional barcode scanner [such as this](https://www.amazon.com/TEEMI-Automatic-Hands-free-presentation-Supermarket/dp/B073J9BJ41), which requires little to no set up with the Rolltrax application.

We provide a full list of recommended barcode scanners, which can be found [here](barcode-scanners.md)
{% endhint %}

However, if for some reason a coordinator is unable to acquire a scanner, the Rolltrax Desktop application now allows teachers to use a standard webcam as a barcode scanner.

The least preferred method is to use the student's phone as the barcode scanner. Keep in mind that while this method requires no other additional components, it is not currently supported by Rolltrax, and may introduce unexpected behavior.

## How do my students sign up for Rolltrax?

There are two ways for students to join Rolltrax: mobile phone or student dashboard.

{% hint style="info" %}
Before you start, make sure you have created an account and made a group for your students to join.

#### Mobile Phone

1. Have your students download the Rolltrax Student app, either by searching for it on the app store, or by clicking this link.
2. If your student does not already have an account, have them sign up in the app. Otherwise, have them log in with their credentials.
3. Have your students click the **Join group** button under the **Me** tab of the app.
4. Your students will then be able to enter the group code \(which can be found on your Teacher Dashboard\) and other relevant information.
5. The students will then be able to click the **Join** button, which will add them to your group.

#### Desktop Web Dashboard

1. Direct your student to https://rolltrax.com in a modern web browser. 
2. If your student does not already have an account, have them sign up in the app. Otherwise, have them log in with their credentials.
3. Once in the student dashboard, have the student click the **Join group** button in the sidebar.
4. Your students will then be able to enter the group code \(which can be found on your Teacher Dashboard\) and other relevant information.
